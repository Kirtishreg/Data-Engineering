Hadoop is a foundational framework in big data engineering that allows for the distributed storage and processing of large datasets across clusters of computers. 
It was one of the first systems to make big data processing scalable and cost-effective using commodity hardware.

Apache Hadoop is an open-source framework that enables:
Storage of large datasets across multiple machines (via HDFS),
Parallel processing of data (via MapReduce or other engines),
Fault tolerance and horizontal scalability.

| Component                                  | Function                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)**  | Distributed storage system for large datasets                 |
| **YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator)** | Resource management and job scheduling                        |
| **MapReduce**                              | Programming model for processing large-scale data in parallel |
| **Common**                                 | Set of shared utilities and libraries used by Hadoop modules  |


Hadoop isn't used alone—it's part of a broader ecosystem that supports data ingestion, processing, querying, and more.

🔽 1. Data Ingestion
Flume – Ingests log data.
Sqoop – Transfers data between Hadoop and relational databases.
Kafka – Real-time data streaming.

🗄️ 2. Data Storage
HDFS – Main storage system.
HBase – NoSQL database on top of HDFS for random, real-time access to big data.

⚙️ 3. Data Processing
MapReduce – Original batch processing engine.
Apache Spark – Faster, in-memory engine for batch and stream processing (now more popular than MapReduce).
Tez – Optimized DAG execution engine for Hive and Pig.
Storm and Flink – Real-time streaming engines.

📊 4. Query & Analysis
Hive – SQL-like querying of large datasets.
Pig – High-level scripting for data transformation.
Impala – Real-time, low-latency SQL queries on HDFS.
Drill – SQL on semi-structured and nested data.

🗂️ 5. Metadata Management
Apache Hive Metastore – Stores schema and metadata for Hive.
Apache Atlas – Data governance and metadata catalog.

🛡️ 6. Security & Monitoring
Ranger – Authorization and audit framework.
Knox – Gateway for securing Hadoop clusters.
Ambari – Management and monitoring tool for Hadoop clusters.

🔄 Typical Hadoop Workflow in Data Engineering
Ingest data (Flume, Sqoop, Kafka)
Store in HDFS
Process with Spark/MapReduce
Transform and analyze using Hive or Pig
Query results or load into a warehouse
Monitor and secure with Ambari, Ranger

✅ Why Hadoop Is Important in Data Engineering
Handles petabytes of data efficiently.
Supports horizontal scaling—just add more nodes.
Fault-tolerant (data replicated across nodes).
Enables batch and stream processing.
Strong integration with modern tools like Spark and Kafka.
