OLAP or Online Analytical Processing

refers to the computing approach allowing users to analyze multidimensional data. Itâ€™s contrasted with OLTP or Online Transactional Processing, a simpler method of interacting with databases, 
not designed for analyzing massive amounts of data from different perspectives.
Information from DWs is aggregated and loaded into the OLAP cube, where it gets precalculated and is readily available for user requests.
